# Functionality
<br>
The game will shuffle the card deck and place cards randomly in appropriate piles upon loading. Currently there is no display for the face down cards when starting in piles 2-7. Additionally the cards are represented by character strings in order of suite and value (i.e. H10 = Ten of hearts, SJ = Jack of spades.)

The player may drag and drop cards between the bottom 7 piles freely at game start as well as click the top left box representing the deck to flip a card. At this point the player may place any visible cards onto any of the 7 play piles in accordance to the rules of solitaire. The player may also move any visible cards to any of the top right piles in accordance to the rules of solitaire. 

# Next Steps
<br>
Currently the game does not allow the player to grab and move stacks of cards between the bottom 7 play piles. This makes the game mostly impossible to complete. I intend to add this functionality in the future along with apropriate images for each card.
